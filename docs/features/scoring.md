# Scoring System Design

## 1. Overview

The scoring system rewards players for predicting match outcomes, group standings, and bracket
progression. Points are awarded per category and summed into a total (`ScoreBreakdown`). Scoring is
pure and deterministic: given a `CardInputs` (raw picks), a `DerivedCard`, and `ActualResults`,
every scoring function returns an exact point total.

All scoring logic lives in `packages/engine/src/scoring/`.

---

## 2. Scoring Categories

### 2.1 Group Match Scoring

Per group match that has been finalised:

| Prediction accuracy                          | Points (WC2026) |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Exact score (home and away goals)            | 6               |
| Correct outcome only (win/draw, wrong goals) | 3               |
| Wrong outcome                                | 0               |

**Implementation:** `scoreGroupMatches()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/group-matches.ts`

Each player predicts a `home:away` score for every group match. Resolved at `actualResults.matchResults`.

---

### 2.2 Group Order Scoring

Per group, once all group matches are final:

| Positions correct                   | Points (WC2026) |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| All 4 correct                       | 6               |
| Exactly 2 correct                   | 3               |
| Exactly 1 correct                   | 1               |
| 3 correct (impossible¹) / 0 correct | 0               |

¹ In a 4-element permutation, getting exactly 3 positions right forces the 4th to also be right.

**Implementation:** `scoreGroupOrder()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/group-order.ts`

`DerivedCard.groupOrders` is computed from the player's group score predictions (via
`deriveGroupOrders()`). Predicted group order is compared position-by-position with
`actualResults.groupOrder[groupId]`.

---

### 2.3 Bracket Picks: R16 and QF (per-team scoring)

WC2026 bracket path: **R32** (32 entry slots) → **R16** (16 matches) → **QF** (8 matches) → **SF**
(4 matches) → **Final + Bronze**.

R16 and QF participants are _derived_ from the player's entry-round knockout picks (not picked
directly). `buildBracket()` propagates winners through the bracket to populate `derived.roundOf16`
and `derived.roundOf8`.

| Category                                                 | Per correct team | Max (WC2026) |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| R16 — teams predicted to reach R16 (`derived.roundOf16`) | 2 pts            | 32 × 2 = 64  |
| QF — teams predicted to reach QF (`derived.roundOf8`)    | 3 pts            | 16 × 3 = 48  |

Resolved when `actualResults.answers.roundOf16` / `.roundOf8` are populated.

**Implementation:** `scoreRoundOf16()`, `scoreRoundOf8()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/sets-rankings.ts`

---

### 2.4 Semifinalists

`DerivedCard.roundOf4` = the player's 4 QF-winner picks (unordered) — i.e. the four teams the player
predicts will reach the semifinal. Each SF match's two participants are always exactly the winner
picks of its two feeding QF matches, so this is derivable from QF picks alone — present as soon as
the player has made their QF picks, independent of whether they've made SF, Final, or Bronze picks
yet. (This is a **separate field** from `DerivedCard.topFour` — see §3 — which is order-dependent
and used only for the Predict page's "predicted final standings" display, not for scoring.)

Scoring counts how many of those four teams are in `actualResults.answers.roundOf4` (teams
confirmed to have won their QF match), **order-agnostic**. `answers.roundOf4` is auto-derived from
QF match winners in `scripts/sync.ts` — same pattern as `roundOf16`/`roundOf8` — so this resolves
incrementally as QF matches complete, not at the end of the tournament.

| Correct semifinalists | Points (WC2026) |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| 4                     | 20              |
| 3                     | 15              |
| 2                     | 10              |
| 1                     | 5               |
| 0                     | 0               |

**Implementation:** `scoreTopFour()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/sets-rankings.ts`

---

### 2.5 Final and Bronze Match Scoring

These two matches use _derived_ participants, not the explicit bracket winner pick.

| Derived field        | Source                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `derived.finalists`  | SF winner picks (2 SF bracket picks)                                 |
| `derived.bronzePair` | SF losers: each SF's non-winner participant derived from QF+SF picks |

Per finale match (same formula for both):

| Component                                | Points (WC2026) | Condition                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Per derived team present in actual match | 5               | 0, 1, or 2 teams can match |
| Exact predicted score                    | 5               | `finishScores.[final       | bronze]` matches actual home/away goals |

**Max per match:** 2 × 5 + 5 = **15 points**

The explicit knockout pick for the bronze/final winner slot is **not directly scored**. Its only
role is in the UI (showing pick status) and in the `canStillGet` calculation (see §4). The actual
points come entirely from `derived.bronzePair` / `derived.finalists`.

This means:

- Getting both SF losers right → 10 bronze pts (regardless of who the explicit bronze pick is).
- Predicting the exact final score → 5 pts (regardless of which finalists actually play).

**Implementation:** `scoreBronze()`, `scoreFinal()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/finish-matches.ts`

---

### 2.6 Special Bets

Single-event predictions scored as boolean matches. Points awarded only after the answer is
officially resolved in `actualResults.answers`.

| Bet key                      | Points (WC2026) | Kind                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| `topScorerPlayer`            | 15              | Player — set match   |
| `finalDecisiveGoalPlayer`    | 20              | Player — exact match |
| `firstRedCardPlayer`         | 20              | Player — exact match |
| `mostYellowCardsTeam`        | 15              | Team — set match     |
| `groupTopScoringTeam`        | 10              | Team — set match     |
| `groupTopConcedingTeam`      | 10              | Team — set match     |
| `tournamentTopScoringTeam`   | 10              | Team — set match     |
| `tournamentTopConcedingTeam` | 10              | Team — set match     |
| `highestMatchGoals`          | 10              | Number — exact match |
| `penaltyShootoutCount`       | 10              | Number — exact match |
| `finalDecidedByPenalties`    | 10              | Bool — exact match   |

**Set match** bets award points if the player's pick is one of the resolved answers (handles ties).
**Exact match** bets require a single strict equality.

**Implementation:** `scoreSpecials()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/specials.ts`

## 3. Derived Card Architecture

Raw picks flow through `buildBracket()` to produce the intermediate `BracketResult` / `DerivedCard`
that all scoring functions consume:

```
CardInputs (raw picks)
  └─ buildBracket(tournament, groupOrders, qualifiers, knockoutPicks)
       ├─ roundOf16  — teams in R32 slots (implicit R16 participants)
       ├─ roundOf8   — teams in QF entry slots (implicit QF participants)
       ├─ finalists  — SF winner picks (→ Final participants)
       ├─ bronzePair — SF losers derived from SF winner pick + SF participants
       ├─ roundOf4   — the 4 QF-winner picks (predicted semifinalists) — used for SF scoring
       └─ topFour    — [finalWinner, finalLoser, bronzeWinner, bronzeLoser] — Predict page display only
```

Key invariants:

- `bronzePair` is _never_ the explicit bronze bracket pick; it is always the two SF losers.
- `roundOf4` needs only the 4 QF-winner picks; it does not depend on SF, Final, or Bronze picks.
- `topFour` requires all four of final+bronze to be resolved; it may be shorter for partial cards.
  It is **not** used for scoring (see §2.4) — only for the Predict page's ordered standings display.
- Stale picks (team not a match participant) are silently dropped; partial cards score 0 for
  unresolvable rounds.

**Implementation:** `buildBracket()` — `packages/engine/src/bracket.ts`

---

## 4. "Can Still Get" Calculation

Each player's **can-still-get** is the maximum additional points still achievable from their
current picks given tournament state. It is used in:

- The player's own breakdown panel (current user path).
- The projected standings table (all users path).

### 4.1 Current User Path

Computed in `buildKnockoutRoundBreakdown()` — `apps/web/src/features/results/application/get-results-view.ts`.

Uses `BracketHealth` rows derived from the current user's real picks.

**Per-team rounds (R16, QF):**

```
canStillGet = health.maxPossiblePoints - health.earnedPoints
```

`maxPossiblePoints = (alivePicks + pendingPicks) × ptsPerPick`

**Top-four:**

```
sfRemaining  = sfHealth.totalPicks - sfHealth.bustedPicks
sfMaxPossible = topFourTierMax(sfRemaining)
canStillGet   = sfMaxPossible - (alreadyEarned)
```

`sfHealth.totalPicks` equals the number of QF matches (4 for WC2026), not the number of picks
made. Busted QF picks reduce the achievable tier; unpicked slots do not.

**Final / Bronze:**
Both finals slots (home/away) are occupied by _derived_ participants from the two SF picks.

```
bustedSfPicks         = finalistHealth.bustedPicks   // wrong SF winner picks
effectiveBronzeBusted = max(bustedSfPicks, bronzePicksBusted)
canStillGet           = max(0, (2 - bustedCount)) × perTeam + exactScore
```

For `bronzePicksBusted`, two scenarios must be distinguished:

| Scenario                                                                                  | Bronze participants known?        | Count toward bronzePicksBusted?                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit bronze bracket pick is wrong team (not a SF loser), actual SF losers still alive | Yes (homeTeamId + awayTeamId set) | **No** — explicit pick irrelevant to derived scoring |
| Explicit bronze bracket pick is for a team eliminated from the tournament                 | No (participants null, null)      | **Yes** — elimination implies SF-loser slot is lost  |

When bronze participants are both confirmed, `pickStatus === 'busted'` means only the explicit
winner pick is wrong — the derived pair (`bronzePair`) is unaffected and full team points remain
attainable. Only count `pickStatus === 'busted'` when participants are unknown (elimination case).

### 4.2 Other Users Path

Computed in `buildPerUserKnockoutCanStillGet()` — `apps/web/src/features/results/application/build-race-view.ts`.

Uses `MatchRow[]` directly to detect eliminated teams. Applies the same logic:

- **Top-four:** count non-busted QF picks → `topFourTierMax(n)`
- **Final/Bronze:** count busted SF-slot pairs → `max(0, 2 - busted) × perTeam + exactScore`

---

## 5. Max Remaining Points (Upper Bound)

`computeRemainingMaxPoints()` — `packages/engine/src/scoring/remaining-max.ts`

Returns the theoretical maximum still attainable across all categories given which matches are
final. Used as the ceiling for `canStillGet` calculations and for the "missed" figure
(`maxFromResolved - earned`).

Notable conservative choices:

- `roundOf16` and `roundOf8` are locked to 0 once the group stage is complete (bracket is fixed).
- `topFour` is locked once both Final and Bronze are played.
- Specials are treated as fully open until the whole tournament is complete.
